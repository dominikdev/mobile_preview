Bitcoin Pricing Responsive App
==============
This was just a simple personal project that i put together to get some practice graphing data in javascript. It's built to mimic a bitcoin exchange website divided into four sections: Home, Pricing Data, Wallet, & News. When viewed on a computer, all four sections are displayed at once. Then on a mobile device, the sections are broken up and a navigation bar pops up. There is no connection to a bitcoin price index so all of the data is randomly generated as needed.
