Mobile Preview Framework
==============
This is a bare bones framework that i developed to help show how responsive websites are displayed on a mobile device. I find it useful when previewing responsive website designs for my clients, or when creating informational pages about personal projects. It allows me to display both versions on a non mobile device. 

This is not intented to be a replacement for actual mobile testing of a website as it only forces the website to display at a resolution of 320px by 568px (Non-Retina Iphone 5). There is many more factors that must be accounted for when optimizing a website for mobile.

How It Works
--------------
The Mobile Preview has an input field to display any URL you choose. This input will also accept the preview of local files. This is useful to help you visualize a page that you are working on. It's also useful when previewing responsive website designs to clients.


Project Notes
--------------
- *Please note that this framework will only work on RESPONSIVE websites and not mobile websites.*

- *This should not be used as a replacement for actually testing your design on a mobile device. It only mimics the screen resolution of a mobile device, not the characterstics of a mobile browser*
